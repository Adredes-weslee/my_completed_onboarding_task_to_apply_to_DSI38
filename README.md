# my_completed_onboarding_task_to_apply_to_DSI38
This is the task that was given to me when I submitted my application to GA for their Data Science Immersive bootcamp.
My submission date for the task was 15th May 2023. There were a series of questions to answer and the task was tool agnostic. 
Applicants could use python, excel or other software to complete the task. I have uploaded my python notebook to Github for 2 reasons:

a) As a barometer of my journey towards making data science a career. I have a snapshot of my abilities at the very start of my journey.
This will allow me to chart my progress and will serve to encourage me should I hit a roadblock. Seeing how I have improved is definitely a great 
way to take stock of my achievements. One has to celebrate victories, no matter how small, on our journey towards a (current) distant goal.

b) Precisely because I chose to use python to complete the task, despite being at best a beginner in programming. This represents the actual start
of my journey towards a data sceience career. I admit I have wanted to embark upon this journey for a couple of years now, but have always been afraid.
I had to spend a whole week reading texts and going through 'newbie' python notebooks before I even felt ready to attempt the task in python. And I still 
had to google A LOT. Furthermore, although the task was supposed to only take a few hours, I spent almost 12 hours just trying to get the desired (but far 
from perfect, at least in terms of data visualization) output. I didn't find the task easy at all, but the fact is I have started and yes, I could have 
started years ago, but I didn't. There is a saying that the best time to plant an oak tree is a hundred years ago, but the second best time is now. So no 
matter how hard this will be, I will see this through, for myself.
